# Google Forms Auto-Submitter 🚀

## Overview 📄

This Python script enables automatic submission of Google Forms. It allows dynamic input of form fields and submission count, making it perfect for testing and data entry automation. The script prompts the user for necessary inputs, making it versatile for various forms.

## Requirements 🛠️

- **Python 3.x**: Ensure Python is installed on your operating system.
- **Requests Library**: This script uses the `requests` library to handle HTTP requests.

## Installation 🔧

First, make sure that Python and pip are already installed on your system. Install the required `requests` library using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Configuration and Usage 🚀

1. **Download the script** to your local machine.
2. **Open your command line interface** and navigate to the script's directory.
3. **Execute the script** by running:
   ```bash
   python form_submitter.py
   ```
4. **Follow the interactive prompts** to configure the form URL, input field names, values, and the number of submissions.

## Features 🌟

- **Dynamic Field Configuration**: Users can input any number of fields as required by the form.
- **Automatic URL Correction**: Ensures the form URL ends with `/formResponse`.
- **Customizable Submissions**: Users can specify the number of form submissions.

## How It Works 🤖

- The script initially prompts for the form's URL. Users can use a default or specify a new one.
- Users are then prompted to enter each form field name and its corresponding value. Input 'done' when all fields have been added.
- Finally, users specify how many times the form should be submitted.
